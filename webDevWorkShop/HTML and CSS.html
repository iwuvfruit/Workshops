html is like reading english, you don't run it.
it's static. it's base building block is the tag 
ex) <h1>this content is inside the tag</h1>
often tags have other tags inside it 
h1 = header h2=second level ... h6 
with css you can change the look 
we use tag 1)for ethical reason(blind ppl) 2)readability/maintability/reusability 3)google look for tags
void tag: self closing tag ex)<input /> => allows users to put something in a box. 
p tags, - paragraph:only texts can go in there. no tags
a anchor - links: <a href="naver.com">naver</a> href is the attribute
div - division, cardboard box. no meaning put stuff into it, useful for styling css 
span - small block snippset, it's like ziploc bag 
ol- ordered list, instead of bullet there's number 
ul -unordered list
li -list 
it's like<ul><li>bob</li><li>sammy</li></ul>
button- can be used with javascript, without javascript it's just a clickable button. <button>click me</button>
img - self tag, give it a source to the pic, giving alt as an attribute too. <img src ="www.pic.com/pic/1" alt="always need it"/> you can put img with css too. css can't do alt tag. 
input- people can type into. there's many various  inputs. 
textarea- instead of input, larger input for larger text. it's not self closing tag.
select, option- <select><option value="seattle">seattle</option><option value="vancouver">vancouver</option>
<form>-grouping stuff like input, textarea
table- it's like a making table in word, excel. not good for style. <table><tr><td>(0,0)</td><td>(1,0)</td></tr></table> 
there are tags like nav, article,
comments- <!-- this is a comment --> to make it readable/understandable/no need to be clever, comment! 

attribute, need additionall data for tag. such as <input type="checkbox" /> input is the tag and type is the attribute. for instance <input type="number" /> you can only put number here 
not all tags have attribute
types of attributes for inputs
<input value="prefilled value" />
<input placeholder="grey placeholder" />
<input type="checkbox" checked/> it;s like checked=true
<input type="radi" checked>
<input type="radi" disabled checked>
<input type="checkbox" value"#FF0000" />

classes:labeling different kind of div with classes 
if it's div then it's green. but so many divs, so using classes labeled classes are only green
classes are used only by you so name good things
<div class="header">
	<h1 class="header-title">heloo</h1>
	<div class ="post">
		<p class="post-text">djlkj
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class ="post">
		<p class="post-text">still usable
		</p>
	</div>
	<div id="only-one">
		<p>don't use id alot. it's like a sledge hammer</p>
	</div>
</div>

you can have multiple classes, but only one id. so it's unique
it's not reusable so not used alot. 
ids are useful for linking, directing me directly to that point. browser navigates to that point
<a href="#idname">link</a>
naming:	write a good name. with classes name things semantically-what it does not what it looks like. looks change all the time, name it with something that sticks. ex)post-title, blog-title, not boldtitle or redtitle
html isn't case sensitive so camel case is useful
so use kehab-case 

html-base structure-boiler plate 
<!DOCTYPE html> <!--to let the browser we are doing html5, should be at the top --> 
<html lang="en"> <!--everything needs to go inside html, we are saying we are submitting english document --> 
<head> <!--head and header are different, in head all the meta informations go here--> 
	viewport goes here too, you can't really see but stuff to configure the website. like mobile screen size info
	<title>title goes here</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>

</html>
html and javascript files will be in seperate and will be linked with a script tag. same with css using link tag.
you can use style tag but not used it often. 

css-cascading style sheet
its a series of rules: if it's that then apply this
using selector h1
h1{
	color:red; color is called a property, red is called a value that css understands. and theres a semicolon 
	font-size: 60px; there's many measurements beside px and em
	em is for relative size. px is an absolute size. em is relative to font size. 
	font-weight:normal; you can make it bold, light 
	text-decoration: underline;
	text-transform: uppercase;
	border: 3px solid pink; combining css properties, short hand

}
parents and children:
div{
	color:blue;
}
<div>
<h1>h1 is the child and div is the parent
</h1>
</div>
because h1 is inside div it will be blue. child follows parent 

div, h1 takes the whole line.
span specific block 

ol{
	list-style:upper-roman;
}
you can do list-style:square even for ol but dont
cascade:
	.branding {
		clolr:red; . is for class
	}
	don't style on tags, style on classes.
	style on tags only if you want the effect on every single one. 
	go with classes! 
cascade: two css clsses that have conflicting classes. 
.other-title{
	color:red
}
.title{
	color:red;
}
.title{
	color:green
}
the one that comes later withs
<h1 class="title other-title">cool title</h1>
it will be green. the one that comes down will always win
but not a good idea to have same two class names.
.main {
	border:1px solid black;
	color:red;
}
.title{
	color:green;
}
color is green but there's border
we are cascading down to one summary effeect.

specificity: two selectors are equal since they have the same specificity.
keep everything simple as it gets deeper

when there are multiple classes more specific one has higher specificity
.main-brand-3.title-3{//no space between classes
	color:red;
}
.title-3{
	color:green
}
<h1 class="title-3 main-brand-3">brand</h1>
it w ill be red
<h1 class="title-3"> this is green because must match all.</h1> 
classes are more specific than tags 
h1.titile{ shouldn't mix tag and classes usually
	color:red
}
.main.titile{
	color:green //this wins 
}

//don't use this, it's a wrecking ball. very strong 
styling id, one id overpowers
/* this is how you do 
 *
 *no need for stars
 *but still this is how
 *you do comment
 */
#id{
	color:red;
}
.nav.hdd{
	color:green
}
id overrides it
h1{
	color: green !important;
}
!important overrides everything
don't use id and !important. 

some wrote it with class
then re wrote it with another class 
but then someone wrote with id(you can oonly do one id)
combining id with class isn't good though
then someone with important
not good! 
use dev tools to avoid this. 

pseudoclass:ex)hover mouse there and change. (hover class)
.hover-example {
	background-color:black;
	width:150px;
	height:150px;
}
.hover-example:hover { /*using hover class next : 
	background-color:crimson;
	width:150px;
	height:150px;
}
hover is a class so it's specificity is a class 
.hover-example.hover-example { /*this one has the specificity 
	background-color:red;
	width:150px;
	height:150px;
}
but at the bottom so it will be red

another pseudoclass is first-child
.first-child-example{
	color:crison;
}
.first-child-example:first-child{
	color:green;
}
.first-child-example:nth-child(2n+1){
	color:red;
}
<ol>
	<li class="first-child-example">first</li>
	<li class="first-child-example">second</li>	
	<li class="first-child-example">third</li>	
</ol>
<style>
	*{
		color:red;
		box-sizing: border-box; //
	}
	specificity of zero, it selects/applies all
</style>
you don't really need float but we used to use alot 
float: left; go as far as you can. kept pushing to the left 
there's a better way to do it, and it'called flex 

div usually take the whole line unless you do something like float 

Box model 
display:what mode measurement is made by 
display:block// 100percent width
display:span //display inline 
display:inline
display:inline-block
display:flex 
display:grid

//padding is inside the the border
//margin is outside the border
.example{
	border: 3px solid red;
	padding: 5px;
	margin:25px; 
	background-color:white;
}
